## Parameter Estimation Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method for determining the values of parameters in a model that best explain observed data.
It involves finding the values of parameters that maximize the likelihood function, which measures the probability of observing the given data given the model and its parameters. 

Step 1: Specify the Likelihood Function

Step 2: Take the logarithm of the likelihood function

Step3: Maximize it by differentiating it with respect to the parameter and equate it to 0.

### Practice Questions

1. Let (𝑋1, 𝑋2,…,)be a random sample of size n taken from a Normal Population with
parameters: mean= 𝜃1 and variance=𝜃2. Find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates of
these two parameters.

2. Let X_1, X_2 . . . ,X_n be a random sample from B(m, θ) distribution, where θ ∈Θ =
(0, 1) is unknown and ‘m’ is a known positive integer. Compute value of θ using the
Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
